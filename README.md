# LoadApp


This course is all about notification and custom animation. The lessons include Using Notification, Creating `Custom Views`, Drawing on `Canvas` Objects, `Clipping Canvas` Objects, Android Property Animations, and Using `MotionLayout` to `Animate` Android Apps.

## What I learned?

* Custom View (create custom `view` / button by inheriting View)
* Custom Attributes (create custom attributes using `withStyledAttributes()`)

* ValueAnimator (use ValueAnimator and Paint to perform `animations`)
* `Canvas` (use paint to draw the `Canvas UI`)
* `MotionLayout` (use MotionLayout and MotionScene to perform animation)
* `Notification` (send notification and use pendingIntent to create the notification action)

## This is how the app looks like:
